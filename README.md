# Fine-tuning TinyLLAMA for Color Description and Prediction

Welcome to the repository for fine-tuning the TinyLLAMA model for color description and prediction. In this project, we leverage the power of AI and fine-tuning techniques to enable machines to understand and predict colors from descriptions.

## Overview

This project aims to bridge the gap between human perception of colors and machine understanding. By combining state-of-the-art AI models, carefully curated datasets, and innovative techniques, we've developed a system capable of predicting colors based on textual descriptions.

## Features

- Fine-tuned TinyLLAMA model for color prediction
- Utilization of Lora configuration for model optimization
- Training on a dataset sourced from Kaggle
- Integration of BitsAndBytes quantization for efficient computation
- Training with the Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library
